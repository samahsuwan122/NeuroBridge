# NeuroBridge — Project State / Handoff

_Last updated: 2026-07-09_

This file is a handoff/state snapshot so a future session can continue without
losing context. It complements `CLAUDE.md` (rules) and
`PROJECT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (roadmap).

## 1. Project name

NeuroBridge — mobile-first, AI-powered cognitive rehabilitation and monitoring
platform. **Not a diagnostic medical system.**

## 2. Current status

- Phase 22A (Progress Analytics Dashboard) completed and committed locally.
  Progress now shows **performance summary cards, latest activity, game
  breakdown, and recent activity**. Analytics are calculated from existing result
  data only. **No backend, API, database, game-result saving, or business logic
  changes** were made. Progress analytics are **performance summaries only, not a
  medical assessment**; no diagnosis, disease prediction, dementia score,
  Alzheimer score, medical interpretation, or treatment recommendation.
- Latest local commit: `9846f31 feat(mobile): add progress analytics dashboard`
- Last pushed commit: `cd2029e` — the Phase 15–22 commits are **not pushed yet**
  (`origin/main` is behind local `main`).
- Working tree is clean (after this docs commit).

- Phase 21A: Reaction Time playable game (mobile; backend already seeded)
- Phase 21B: Attention Tap playable game (mobile; backend already seeded)
- Phase 21C: Sequence Recall playable game (mobile; backend already seeded)
- Phase 22A: Progress analytics dashboard (mobile; performance summaries only)

## 4. Demo login (LOCAL DEV ONLY — fake accounts)

- Email: `patient.demo@neurobridge.local`
- Password: `Demo12345!`

(Other demo roles use the same password: `admin.demo@`, `family.demo@`,
`doctor.demo@`, `therapist.demo@` `@neurobridge.local`. Created by
`python -m app.scripts.seed_demo_data`.)

## 5. Current working feature

Phase 22 — Progress Analytics. **Step 22A (dashboard) is complete and committed.**
Mobile-only, **no backend/API/result-logic changes** (analytics are pure
client-side computations over existing results). The Progress screen is now a
premium **performance analytics dashboard**: `ProgressAnalytics.from(results)`
derives total exercises, completed count, best and average score %, latest
activity, and a per-game breakdown; the UI shows summary cards, a Game breakdown
section, and a Recent activity list. Everything is **performance-only** — no
diagnosis, cognitive level, or normal/abnormal wording. Loading/empty/error
states unchanged. **Next step: Phase 22B — Family / Doctor Progress Review.**

## 6. Phase 13 summary (done)

- Progress screen (`/progress`) opened from the Home Progress card.
- Loads saved results from `GET /api/v1/games/results`, joined with
  `GET /api/v1/games` for titles (fallback to id).
- Shows game title, score/max, duration, completed, date, moves/mistakes with
  safe loading/empty/error+retry states. No charts. Game performance only.

## 7. Next step

Phase 22B — Family / Doctor Progress Review. Optional follow-ups also remain:
edit/delete/replace UI for memories, or charts/trends on the dashboard. Also: the
Phase 15–22 commits are committed locally but **not pushed** — push when ready.

## 8. Medical safety rules

- No diagnosis.
- No disease prediction.
- No dementia score.
- No Alzheimer score.
- No medical interpretation.
- Results are game/exercise performance only.

## 9. Run commands

Backend:

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m alembic upgrade head
python -m app.scripts.seed_demo_data
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Mobile:

```powershell
cd mobile
flutter run -d chrome --web-port=3000
```

(Use `--web-port=3000` so the browser origin matches the backend CORS allowlist.)

## 10. Testing commands

Backend:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
```

Mobile:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build web
```
